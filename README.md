   Write a program that takes input from stdin with the following properties:
   - Input is split into lines delimited by newline characters.
   - Every line has the same length.
   - Every line consists of an arbitrary sequence of hyphens ("-") and asterisks ("\*").
   - The final line of input is terminated by a newline character.

  * Problem statement:
  ```
  The attached text file contains the favorite musical artists of 1000 users from Some Popular Music Review Website. Each line is a list of up to 50 artists, formatted as follows:
  Radiohead,Pulp,Morrissey,Delays,Stereophonics,Blur,Suede,Sleeper,The La's,Super Furry Animals,Iggy Pop\n Band of Horses,Smashing
  Pumpkins,The Velvet Underground,Radiohead,The Decemberists,Morrissey,Television\n
  etc.
  
  Write a program that, using this file as input, produces an output file containing a list of pairs of artists which appear TOGETHER in at
  least fifty different lists. For example, in the above sample, Radiohead and Morrissey appear together twice, but every other pair
  appears only once. Your solution should be a csv, with each row being a pair. For example:
  
  Morrissey,Radiohead\n
  ```
